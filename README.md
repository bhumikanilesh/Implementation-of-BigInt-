# Implementation-of-BigInt-
BigInt implementation in C is a well-structured program that allows arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, and multiplication) on arbitrarily large integers. Since built-in integer types in C have size limitations (e.g., int and long long), your implementation represents large numbers as arrays of digits.
